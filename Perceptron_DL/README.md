# Perceptron Deep Learning Model

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the application of a Perceptron model to emulate basic logical operations: NAND, AND, and XOR gates. It aims to provide an understanding of neural networks' fundamental functionality through simple binary classification tasks.

## Features
- Implementation of Perceptron for NAND, AND, XOR logical operations
- Sample datasets for each logical operation
- Visualization of decision boundaries
- Scripts for training and evaluating the Perceptron model

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ashut90/ANN.git
cd ANN/Perceptron_DL
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Perceptron model for each logical operation:
```bash
python perceptron_nand.py
python perceptron_and.py
python perceptron_xor.py
```

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the model's functionality or documentation are welcome. Please feel free to submit issues and pull requests.

## Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by the foundational concepts of neural networks and logical operations as basic computational units.
