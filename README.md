# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Project

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to constructing and exploring Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to contribute to and deeply understand machine learning (ML) principles. The project aims to dissect the layers of ANN models, experiment with various architectures, and apply these models to diverse datasets to uncover the intricate workings of ML algorithms.

## Features
- Comprehensive ANN model implementations
- Experiments with different ANN architectures
- Data preprocessing and exploration scripts
- Performance evaluation and analysis
- Educational resources for ML enthusiasts

## Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to get a development environment running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ANN/Perceptron.git
cd Perceptron_DL
```
